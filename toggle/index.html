            <h4>Course Objectives:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>To summarize capabilities and impact of software development process models and justify process
                    maturity through application of Software Engineering principles and practices,</li>
                <li> To differentiate feasible and competing system requirements, indicating correct real world
                    problem scope and preparing stepwise system conceptual model,</li>
                <li>To formulate system specifications by analyzing user-level tasks and compose software artifacts
                    using agile principles, practices and scrum framework,</li>
                <li>To compose system analysis and design specifications using UML diagrams,</li>
                <li>To design a system architecture and map it with a suitable architectural style,</li>
                <li>To comprehend the nature of design patterns and apply these patterns in system design.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Course Relevance:</h4>
            Given that Software Engineering is built upon the foundations of Computer Science as well as
            Computer Engineering, a Software Engineering curriculum can be focused on two perspectives - a
            Computer Science-first or Software Engineering-first perspective. Software engineering spans the
            entire software lifecycle. It involves creating high-quality and reliable programs in a systematic,
            controlled, and efficient manner using formal methods for specification, analysis, design and
            evaluation of proposed systems. It requires suitable software development techniques and processes
            that successfully scale to large applications, which should satisfy timing, size, and security
            requirements all within acceptable application/project budgets and deadlines. For these reasons,
            Software Engineering requires both the analytical and descriptive tools and techniques developed in
            Computer Science and the rigor that the Computer Engineering discipline brings to the reliability and
            trustworthiness of the systems that software developers design and implement, while working as a
            cohesive team

            <h4>Course Objectives:</h4>

            <ol>
                <li>To develop critical thinking and problem solving ability by exploring and proposing solutions to
                    realistic/social problems.</li>
                <li>To Evaluate alternative approaches, and justify the use of selected tools and methods,</li>
                <li>To emphasize learning activities those are long-term, inter-disciplinary and student-centric.</li>
                <li>To engage students in rich and authentic learning experiences.</li>
                <li>To provide every student the opportunity to get involved either individually or as a group so as to
                    develop team skills and learn professionalism.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Course Relevance</h4>
            <p>To develop an ecosystem to promote entrepreneurship and research culture among the students
                Course Relevance: Project Centric Learning (PCL) is a powerful tool for students to work in areas
                of their choice and strengths. Along with course based projects, curriculum can be enriched with
                semester long Engineering Design and Development courses, in which students can solve socially
                relevant problems using various technologies from relevant disciplines. The various socially relevant
                domains can be like Health care, Agriculture, Defense, Education, Smart City, Smart Energy and
                Swaccha Bharat Abhiyan. To gain the necessary skills to tackle such projects, students can select
                relevant online courses and acquire skills from numerous sources under guidance of faculty and
                enrich their knowledge in the project domain, thereby achieving project centric learning. Modern
                world sustained and advanced through the successful completion of projects. In short, if students are
                prepared for success in life, we need to prepare them for a project-based world. It is a style of active
                learning and inquiry-based learning. Project centric learning will also redefine the role of teacher as
                mentor in the learning process. The PCL model focuses the student on a big open-ended question,
                challenge, or problem to research and respond to and/or solve. It brings students not only to know,
                understand and remember rather it takes them to analyze, design and apply categories of Bloomâ€™s
                Taxonomy</p>
